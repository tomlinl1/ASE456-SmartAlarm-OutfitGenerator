# SmartAlarm #

***

## What is the problem to solve? ##
I have issues with the built-in Apple alarm because it tends not to be loud enough and likes to go quiet by itself. Overall, it is unreliable.

***

## Why is this problem important to solve? ##
I find this problem important to solve because I have shown up late to events and classes as a result of the alarm app being unreliable. I also want others who have the same issue as me have a solution to their problem as well.

***

## How do I solve this problem? ##
I plan to solve this problem by making a morning routine app that includes an alarm, weather notifications, and suggestions for what outfits to wear based on the user's wardrobe that they can upload to the app. I want the interface to be seamless and neat, as well as allow user customization per their schedule.

Week 1 ( 9/15 - 9/21 )
Team Goals: Create the outline of the app, including what the interface looks like, as well as implement the alarm feature.
- Feature #1:  Alarm and interface.
  - Requirement #2: As a cross-platform developer, I want to create a morning routine app for users, so that they can use an alarm that fits their daily needs.
  - Plan: Create an application that serves as an alarm and has multiple sounds to choose from.
